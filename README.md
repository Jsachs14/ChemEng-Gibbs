FILE INDEX for github

1) dG/dt
Pictures for the derivative of the Gibbs Energy. Includes ternary plots with different deltas, video of ternary plot evolution, and 3D model of Gibbs energy (Total Gibbs energy)

2) Same, but for G

3) unperturbed A
Pictures for just the contribution from the unperturbed substance (just A so far). Includes ternary plot and 3D model

4) simple n=3
A picture illustrating the basic relationship between CPE and Gibbs. Dashed lines represent CPE (y axis) and Eq (x axis)

5) Gibbs_Math 
Running Latex PDF of some of the math used
